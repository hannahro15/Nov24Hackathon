## UX Design


### Accessibility:


### Feedback Mechanism:

- "sent" messages
- Hover and click effects on buttons and links

### Consistency:

The website maintains a consistent design language throughout all screens, using a cohesive color scheme, typography, and layout. This consistency helps users focus on the content and functions without being distracted by changing interfaces.

#### Color scheme

![Four squares, one of a different colour](docs/colour-scheme.png)

The chosen color palette, featuring Deep Teal (#004C6D), Mustard Yellow (#FFB700), Soft Cyan (#B2EBF2), and Charcoal (#36454F), is specifically designed to prioritize accessibility and inclusivity. The combination provides high contrast and visual clarity, making it suitable for users with color vision deficiencies, including deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia. Deep Teal and Charcoal serve as strong base colors, while Mustard Yellow and Soft Cyan add brightness and distinguishable accents. This palette ensures that interactive elements, text, and backgrounds remain easily recognizable, even for users with limited color perception, supporting a user-friendly and inclusive interface.

#### Favicon

### Wireframes

- The website layout is highly simple and centralized. Divs with curved edges were chosen to give a lighter mood to the website. Simple design also helps with clarity and navigation. All buttons are accessible with your thumb closer to the bottom of the page, which can be useful for users with large cellphones.

### Features page

The website offers a simple and intuitive one-page interface designed to provide an accessible and seamless text-to-speech experience. Users can select from three distinct voice options, clearly labeled to highlight differences such as gender or tone, ensuring flexibility and personalization. A single text input field allows users to type or paste their desired text, which is then converted into speech using a robust text-to-speech API. The page features a clean and minimalist design, focusing on functionality and ease of use without unnecessary distractions, making it approachable for users of all skill levels.

## Features left to implement

As part of the project's evolution, the following features are being considered to enhance functionality and accessibility:

1. Playback Controls

   - Add options to pause, stop, and replay the generated audio, providing users with greater flexibility in interacting with the speech output.

2. Adjustable Speech Settings

   - Introduce controls for adjusting speech speed and volume, allowing users to personalize their listening experience.

3. Accessibility Enhancements

    - Explore the addition of screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation to improve accessibility for users with disabilities.

4. Multi-Language Support

    - Investigate expanding text-to-speech capabilities to include multiple languages, making the website more inclusive for a global audience.
  
These features reflect our aspirations to further refine and improve the website's usability in the future.

# Deployment

The website's codebase and all associated files were hosted on GitHub, with the main repository serving as the central hub for collaboration. Each team member forked the repository to work on their assigned tasks independently. These forks were regularly synchronized to ensure the main repository remained up to date. The final live deployment was hosted on Heroku, which was continuously updated to reflect changes pushed to the GitHub repository.
